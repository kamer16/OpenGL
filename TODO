MeshLoader: Handle .obj files with only vertices
MeshLoader: Handle material definition
MeshLoader: Handling multiple textures in object

Buffers: Keep track of resources when generating buffers.  Currently these are
         leaked

Lighting: Compute specular, diffuse and ambiant lighting i-e (phong shading)
Material: Add material to objects such as color, and light reflection color

Texture: Current value of shadert texture coordinates not used generated an
invalid value in glGetError()

RenderScene:  Should create a wrapper class that contains object information and
which can then be attached to a scene (A scene contains a list of objects).
Then a simple update() to the scene draws each objects and also updates the
position of each object.

Texture: texture.cpp currently useless, maybe removing it in the future.
Currently all it does is load images to a program_id.

Lighting: Compute normal matrix is user code not in GPU code

Model Matrix: The rendered oject should each contain a model matrix, and send it
to the gpu before drawing
