OpenGL
======

# Motivation
Use OpenGL 3.3 and it's shader language.
The objective is to create an engine that implements various simulation
algorithm and physics equations to simulate real world phenomenons.

# Current work
* Phong shading
* Multiple render targets
* Deferred shading
* Normal mapping
* Mesh loader of .obj format
* Lighting equations

# Usage
```
./main [-f] [-x widthxheight] [-m file.obj]
```

Options:
*    -f : make full screen
*    -x : change screen resolution
*    -m : load an object file
